# EX:3C SUDOKU SOLVER

### DATE:

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the solution of sudoku puzzle using Backtracking.

## ALGORITHM:

1. Traverse each cell of the Sudoku board.
2. When an empty cell (0) is found, try all digits from 1 to 9.
3. For each digit, check if it is safe to place (not in same row, column, or 3Ã—3 subgrid).
4. If safe, place the digit and recursively solve the rest of the board.
5. If placing the digit leads to no solution, reset the cell and backtrack.
6. If all cells are filled without conflict, print the solved board.
